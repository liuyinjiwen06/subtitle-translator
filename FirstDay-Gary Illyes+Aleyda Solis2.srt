1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,775
As an independent channel
because it doesn't make sense.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,440
It's well aligned with
what we are doing with SEO.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,535
And most have expanded their SEO
affordability to integrate AI search

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,135
optimization and have also added
strategies existing or planned.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,695
AI search optimization work focuses on
strong data, digital PR and founder

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,360
restructuring as we have seen before.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,815
And the goals of AI search optimization
are related to visibility, traffic

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
run, awardness and conversions.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,295
The biggest challenges
are the ones that surprise surprise, have

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,215
to do with measurements
east attribution, data transparency and

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,200
tooling because we don't have
direct resources opportunity.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,735
And speaking of tools, these are types of
tools that are being used nowadays for AI

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,655
search driving and optimization, AQF
analytics, same results again, not

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,320
necessarily different tools than the
one that they apply leveraging for SEO.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,375
So AI search optimization is still massive
and the industry is adapted after

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,335
25 years of stable search evolution.
More or less.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,720
Right?

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,080
Well, here's a new platform that many,
many more are using for somewhat related

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,200
type of needs and we
need to start leveraging.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,200

backlog, SEO initiatives, SEO efforts
to deliver impact that we need today.
