    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about our subtitle translator",
    "q1": {
      "question": "What is an SRT file and how do I get one?",
      "answer": "An SRT (SubRip Subtitle) file is a plain text file containing subtitle information including timing and text. You can extract SRT files from videos using tools like VLC Media Player, download them from subtitle websites, or create them with subtitle editing software. Our translator works with standard SRT format files."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How accurate are the AI translations?",
      "answer": "Our AI-powered translator uses advanced language models (GPT-3.5-turbo) that understand context, idioms, and cultural nuances. While machine translation continues to improve, accuracy is typically 85-95% for common language pairs. For professional use, we recommend reviewing translations, especially for technical or creative content."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I translate subtitles for YouTube videos?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our tool is perfect for YouTube creators. Simply download the SRT subtitle file from YouTube (or create one), translate it using our tool, then upload the translated SRT file back to YouTube. This helps you reach international audiences and grow your channel globally."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is there a limit on file size or number of subtitles?",
      "answer": "Files must be under 5MB, which typically includes several thousand subtitle lines - more than enough for a full-length movie. You can translate up to 50 files per day for free. If you need higher limits for commercial use, please contact us."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What's the difference between mono and bilingual subtitles?",
      "answer": "Mono (single language) subtitles contain only the translated text - perfect for viewers who just need to understand the content. Bilingual subtitles show both original and translated text, ideal for language learners who want to compare translations or viewers who understand both languages."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Do you store or share my subtitle files?",
      "answer": "No, we take privacy seriously. Your files are processed in real-time and automatically deleted immediately after translation. We never store, analyze, or share your content. Your subtitles and videos remain completely private and secure."
